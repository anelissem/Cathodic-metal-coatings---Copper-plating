📘 Project Overview
This project is an interactive web application designed to simulate the cathodic deposition of metals, focusing on the copper plating (cuprarea) process via electrolysis.
The goal is to create an educational and visual tool that demonstrates the physical and chemical principles of metal deposition, helping students and teachers better understand the relationship between electric current, time, and deposited mass according to Faraday’s laws of electrolysis.

🧠 Scientific Background
The copper plating process involves depositing a thin layer of copper on a metallic surface (usually iron or brass) through the passage of electric current in a copper sulfate (CuSO₄) solution.

The mass of copper deposited is directly proportional to the electric charge passed through the electrolyte, as described by Faraday’s Law of Electrolysis:
m
=

I
⋅
t
n
⋅
F
m= 
n⋅F
M⋅I⋅t
​	
 
Where:
m – mass of the deposited metal (g)
M – molar mass of copper (63.546 g/mol)
I – current intensity (A)
t – time (s)
n – number of electrons exchanged (2 for Cu²⁺)
F – Faraday constant (96500 C/mol)
